Setup
Please note, you have to rails db:reset the DB, not rails db:seed everytime you are starting over. We have hard-coded user roles and don't want them to auto-increment (and break).

git clone 
git@github.com:caffkane/admin-group-project.git
cd admin-group-project
yarn install --check-files
bundle install
rails db:reset
rails s
This will clone the integration branch onto your computer.

To execute the rake task to import users from a CSV:

bundle exec rake import_users_csv:import_users_csv
Make sure that the csv is in the root folder of your application.
